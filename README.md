# Completionist-Calculator
## By Samuel Neus

This project is a calculator that determines how difficult a game is to fully complete.
To do this, the user can provide a game's title and—after confirmation from the program—
data from the game will be gathered and calculated.

Notes:
The project functions best when given the names of games on Steam, as data regarding
achievements is taken directly from the Steam store page. For best results please use
titles of games on Steam with achievements.

To Do:
* Make the project fully downloadable

Ongoing:
* Add other relevant information in text, not statistics

Stretch:
* Determine an average score for a user's game collection
* Recommend a game based on a user's game collection

* Determine a game's How Long To Beat id given its name
* Create an advanced table of information
* Can gather Steam achievement information given a game's id
* Can gather How Long To Beat information given a game's id
* Add functionality for Co-op games
* GUI has been made for easier use
