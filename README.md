# Video Game Completionist-Calculator
## By Samuel Neus

This project is a calculator that determines how difficult a game is to fully complete.
To do this, the user can provide a game's title and—after confirmation from the program—
data from the game will be gathered and calculated. The program also has an alternative
feature to examine a user's game library and find their favorite game types.

# Installation
1. Download and extract the ZIP file
2. Run Video_Game_Completionist_Calculator.exe

# Notes:
For best results please use titles of games on Steam with achievements,
as data regarding achievements is taken directly from the Steam store page.

For the user searches, it is important that the user's game collection is
not private, and that they have enabled a Custom URL for their profile.
